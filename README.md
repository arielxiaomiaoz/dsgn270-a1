**What is your overall impression of the site visuals?**

- Through the headings in different areas of the page, the task of each part is obvious. The big link buttons are very easy to access, the position of the link buttons are located properly. The navigation is simple but clear.
- Text are nested in different background, which indicates different functions.

**What is the goal of the website?**
1. Introduce the restaurant. There is a menu of the dishes; a brief and a comprehensive history introduction of the restaurant.
2. Online reservation. No need to sign in, customers can book a reservation through the reservation label, quick and easy.

**Does the website make effective use of visual hierarchy? Why or why not?**

Yes. The website make effective use of visual hierarchy.
- The uniform font style. In this website, headings are using one same font style, the contents are using another font style, they look harmony. 
- The different depth of field. In the reservation part of the page, the background are using a picture of the restaurant but in deep hue. In other parts of the page, using white or black background. These different colors distinguish the different areas and functions of the page, also bring the visual enjoyment.
- The negative space. Text are brief and clear, also there are lot of negative space.

Yes. The text is readable.
In this website,  The background color and the text color are mostly black& white, grey& black, the text color contrasts well with the background color.

## 3.Mobile Responsiveness
**Is there a scroll track on mobile devices.**

There is no scroll track on mobil devices, only scroll thumb are visible. 

**Does the business have an online menu? If so, is it responsive? Can the menu be bookmarked for use in a QR Code?**

Yes, there is an online menu. The menu is for users to acknowledge the dishes of the restaurant but not for order. You can only look into it but unable to do next step. The menu also couldn’t be bookmarked for use in a QR Code.

When access to the mobile page, it is much slower than loading to the web page, it could exceed half a minute to load. Performance are pretty good in computer browsers but not that good in mobile browsers.
